	to data using the R-packages sdcMicro and sdcTable . The reader of
	this chapter should be advised how popular methods in microdata protection
	and tabular protection can be applied within these packages to real-world
	data. sdcMicro supports an exploratory approach for the anonymization
	of both categorical key variables and numerical variables. Hereby,
	global recoding, local suppression, and risk estimation can be applied
	interactively. Furthermore, various popular methods for microdata
	protection will be briefly described, but also some new methods for
	microdata protection and disclosure risk estimation considering real-life
	data problems will be introduced. Additionally, a description of
	how tabular protection can be applied using the R-package sdcTable
	is given. The most challenging part from the user point of view is
	the preliminary data preparation before tabular protection can be
	applied. In this case, meta information about the hierarchical variables
	defining the table must be provided by the user.},
